which user learns now. Considering previous topic user was learning, you will have to
generate list of lessons to learn EXACT PART OF ROADMAP USER IN NOW ON, trying not to repeat
the lessons of the previous topics. Roadmap has to give bt asic level of knowledge, unless said othervise. List of lessons has to be very short, concise and bound ONLY
to chosen tech, no descriptions. Do not include any practical lessons in roadmap(e.g.  Building a Simple App using ... ,JavaScript Best Practices etc).
Do not include technologies, that user has not learned yet. Roadmap length has to be less than 12.
IMPORTANT: dont ever give a choice between technologies in roadmap, choose yourself. Dont include code builders(webpack, babel, gulp) by default. 
This is user's roadmap: {roadmap}.
This is user's current topic: {title}
This is what's your answer should look like:
1.Tech name
